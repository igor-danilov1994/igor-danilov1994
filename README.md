# 👨‍💻 Igor Danilov

## 🧠 About Me  
I’m a 30-year-old developer passionate about building clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications.  
I love working in teams, solving complex problems, and continuously improving my skills. Persistent, curious, and detail-oriented — I never give up until the task is done.  
Outside of coding, I enjoy sports, cars, traveling, and participating in English-speaking clubs.
